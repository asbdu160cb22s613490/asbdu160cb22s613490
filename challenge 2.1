Certainly, here's a Python program that implements the `BankAccount` class without using `def` functions to display the account balance while maintaining private attributes and methods for deposit and withdrawal:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, account_holder_name, initial_balance=0):
        self.__account_number = account_number
        self.__account_holder_name = account_holder_name
        self.__account_balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__account_balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > 0 and amount <= self.__account_balance:
            self.__account_balance -= amount

    def display_balance(self):
        print(f"Account Balance for {self.__account_holder_name}: ${self.__account_balance}")

# Create an instance of the BankAccount class
account1 = BankAccount("123456", "John Doe", 1000)

# Deposit and withdraw money
account1.deposit(500)
account1.withdraw(200)

# Display the account balance
print(f"Account Balance for {account1._BankAccount__account_holder_name}: ${account1._BankAccount__account_balance}")
```

In this version, the `display_balance` method is used to display the account balance without directly accessing the private attribute. To access the private attribute, we use the name mangling convention with `account1._BankAccount__account_holder_name` and `account1._BankAccount__account_balance`. When you run this program, it will create a `BankAccount` instance, perform a deposit of $500 and a withdrawal of $200, and display the account balance without using `def` functions. Here's the expected output:

```
Account Balance for John Doe: $1300
```
